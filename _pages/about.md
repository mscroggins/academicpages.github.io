My name is Michael Scroggins. I am a post-doc at the Center for Knowledge Infrastructures at the University of California, Los Angeles. Prior to joining the CKI, I completed a Ph.D. in Anthropology and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. My scholarly interests include: labor, public education and the education of the public, governance, and the productive side of ignorance and failure. I earned a PhD from Teachers College, Columbia University in 2017 where I studied anthropology of education and wrote a dissertation on the experimental program of DIYbiologists in Silicon Valley. At the Center for Knowledge Infrastructures, I have worked on issues of the maintenance and repair of digital infrastructure, invisible labor in data-intensive science, and the political economy of science. Currently, I am conducting fieldwork with astronomers, investigating the role data quality (as opposed to data quantity) plays in establishing, forming, and continuing long-term scientific collaborations. My next project will interrogate how Agtech and Data-intensive farm management are refiguring farm work, taking the evolution the farm tractor as physical, and now, digital infrastructure as the point of departure.
