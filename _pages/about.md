I am an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation funded postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Knowledge Infrastructures, University of California, Los Angeles. I hold a PhD in anthropology and education from Teachers College, Columbia University, graduating in May 2017. My research takes a critical and historical lens to the social organization of scientific and technical work, employing ethnographic methods augmented by material culture studies and interactional analysis. My pedagogical practice uses experiential and studio techniques to bring a human-centered perspective to the design of social-technical systems.
