I am a lecturer at the Institute for Society and Genetics at the University of California, Los Angeles where I teach <i>Data in and of a Pandemic</i>,  <i>DIYbio Between Art, Science, and Market</i>, <i>The Biology Business, or Biotech in the Neoliberal Imaginary</i>, and in the freshman cluster Biotechnology and Society. Formerly, I was an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation funded postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Knowledge Infrastructures, University of California, Los Angeles. I hold a PhD in anthropology and education from Teachers College, Columbia University, graduating in May 2017. I finished a BA in Liberal Arts at The Evergreen State College. Between degrees I worked as a bookseller.

My main intellectual engagements have been with Do-it-Yourself biology (DIYbio) and data-intensive science. My research takes a critical and historical lens to the social organization of scientific and technical work, employing ethnographic methods augmented by material culture studies and interactional analysis, to understand the criteria and ramifications of scientific truth claims.

Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork at the Silicon Valley DIYbio laboratory Biocurious, my dissertation demonstrated how the laboratory’s design language enforced an organizational culture leading to safe experimental practice yet constrained Biocurious’ ability to fulfill its mission to democratize genetic engineering. An in-progress manuscript <i>Glowing Plants and Farting Unicorns: DIYbio in Silicon Valley</i> develops a critique of neoliberal approaches to innovation discourse and practice. During my postdoc at the CKI, I focused on the invisible labor behind data creation in data-intensive science, pushing back against the uncritical reception of data as a given, by demonstrating how scientific data is the product of historically and socially situated labor.

I also have worked on a wide range of academic and applied  projects, such as the CSU Fresno library project and the Fair Money project. I have designed curriculum for and taught ethnographic methods to industrial designers and written critically on the Culture of Poverty thesis  and its reception within anthropology.

Currently I am working on two projects: The first is a short-term project that uses the biographies of DIYbiologists as a lens to understand how a new class of entrepreneurs who gained biotech experience in DIYbio laboratories are creating new markets for cellular agriculture, direct-to-consumer GMOs, and home-brewed pharmaceuticals. A long-term research project titled <i>Do Your Own Research!</i> uses the tools of anthropology and STS to understand the creation, dissemination, and curation of scientific misinformation. Through a close case study of the scientifically debunked yet recently resurgent Terrain Theory of Disease, this study conceptualizes the moral injunction to "do your research" as a type of DIY science and examines its effects on the public reception of scientific expertise about SARS-coV-2.
